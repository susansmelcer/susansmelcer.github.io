I am an Assistant Professor of Law at Georgia State University College of Law (currently on professional leave as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Wake Forest University's Department of Politics and International Affairs. My research is  motivated by my desire to understand how we can use both legal and social science methods and tools to describe, explain, and evaluate judicial and regulatory behavior. This work reflects both my training as a legal scholar and political scientist with expertise in quantitative methods and computational text analysis. 

My legal scholarship primarily examines the effects of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) disclosure-based regulatory framework on mutual fund disclosures through a quantitative lens. In a series of recent projects, My colleagues at Georgia State and I have developed text-based measures to evaluate funds’ compliance with the SEC’s principles-based disclosure regime. 

I am also currently working on several projects related to the historical development of judicial behavior and procedure in the federal courts and the evolution of opinion-writing norms over the Supreme Court’s history. One, tentatively entitled _The Institutional Development of Dissent_, is an outgrowth of my dissertation. The other is a new coauthored project examining the changing norms around the use of _aggressive_ or _uncollegial_ language in Supreme Court opinions over time. 

My other coauthored courts-related research projects reflect my interest in civil procedure. One examines the development and use of informal en banc procedures by the U.S. Courts of Appeals. The other explores federal courts’ creation of procedural tools to bolster civil rights–related claims against local prejudice during the Reconstruction era.
